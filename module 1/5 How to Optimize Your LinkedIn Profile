In today’s digital world, your LinkedIn profile is more than just an online resume; it’s your professional storefront. As a freelancer, your LinkedIn page can help you attract clients, showcase your skills, and build a network that leads to paid opportunities. Whether you are starting from scratch or improving what you already have, this lesson will walk you through the steps to create a compelling LinkedIn presence.

Step 1. Set Up Your LinkedIn Account
To begin, if you don’t already have a LinkedIn account, sign up for one here: https://www.linkedin.com/signup

Once you’re signed in, take time to explore how LinkedIn works. Check out profiles of professionals you admire, follow industry pages, and begin understanding the language of your field.

Step 2. Use a Clear, Global-Friendly Name
What to do:
Update your display name to the global standard: First Name Last Name.

Why this matters:
In many African countries, it’s customary to put the surname first. However, LinkedIn is a global platform. Using the international naming format ensures your name is easily understood and found by recruiters and clients worldwide.

Bonus Tip:
Avoid using all caps or nicknames (unless that’s how you’re known professionally). Consistency helps build recognition.

Step 3. Add a Strong Profile Photo
What to do:
Upload a professional photo that shows your face clearly, with good lighting and a neutral or tidy background.

Why this matters:
A profile with a photo gets more views. People connect more easily with faces, and a professional-looking image builds trust and makes you appear approachable.

Bonus Tip:
You don’t need a studio photo! A well-lit smartphone photo in natural light works just fine. Ensure your face is centered and the photo is not blurry or pixelated.

Step 4. Customize Your URL
What to do:
Click “Public profile & URL” in the top right of your LinkedIn profile, and edit your LinkedIn URL to reflect your name, e.g., linkedin.com/in/yourname.

Why this matters:
Your LinkedIn profile URL appears in the navigation bar when someone is looking at your profile. A clean, custom URL is easier to remember, looks more polished on resumes and business cards, and improves your visibility in search engines.

Bonus Tip:
If your name is taken, try variations like yourname-freelancer or yourname-uxwriter.

Step 5. Write a Clear and Compelling Headline
What to do:
Write a short sentence or phrase that describes what you do and the value you bring. Instead of just “Freelancer” or “Student,” add your role and what you offer. Think of it as a one-line pitch.

Examples:
Digital Illustrator | Bringing brands to life with bold visual stories
Virtual Assistant | Reliable remote support for busy entrepreneurs

Why this matters:
Your headline shows up in searches, connection requests, and comments. It’s often the first thing people read after your name. A strong headline helps you get noticed and understood quickly.

Bonus Tip:
Include keywords that clients might search for, such as “web designer,” “copywriter,” or “brand strategist.” Also, avoid buzzwords like “guru” or “ninja” unless that’s part of your brand.

Step 6. Fill Out Your Experience and Education
What to do:
Add recent internships and jobs, freelance gigs, volunteer work, and education. For each entry, write 2–3 bullet points that describe your contributions and tools used. Use similar language to your resume.

Why this matters:
This section shows what you’ve done and what you can do again. Even short-term gigs or unpaid projects build credibility and give clients insight into your skills.

Bonus Tip:
If you’re just starting out, include course projects, internships, or personal projects that reflect your abilities and interests.

Step 7. Make Your Profile Public
What to do:
Go to “Settings & Privacy” → “Visibility” → “Edit your public profile” and make sure your profile photo, name, headline, and summary are visible to everyone. You can edit the parts of your profile that you want to be visible to the public under the “Edit Visibility” section.

Why this matters:
If your profile is private, clients won’t see enough to want to connect or reach out. A public profile increases your visibility and ensures you appear in search results.

Bonus Tip:
Review your privacy settings regularly. You can choose to show or hide other elements (like experience or contact info) based on your comfort level.

Step 8. Use the Featured Section to Highlight Your Work
What to do:
Use the “Featured” section to add links to your portfolio, work samples, case studies, or media coverage.

Why this matters:
This section acts as a visual portfolio within your profile. It helps people quickly see your best work and understand the kind of projects you take on.

Bonus Tip:
Link to external platforms like Behance, personal websites, Google Drive folders, or YouTube. Make sure the links are live and up to date!

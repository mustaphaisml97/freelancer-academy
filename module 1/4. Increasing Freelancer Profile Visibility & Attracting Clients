Freelance Profile DOs and DON’Ts
When creating your freelance profile, presentation and integrity are everything. Here’s a quick guide to help you make the right impression—and avoid common mistakes.

DOs ✅
Use relevant keywords in your profile, title, and gig descriptions to improve search visibility.
Write a compelling bio that highlights your skills, experience, and unique value proposition.

Upload a strong portfolio showcasing your best work with detailed descriptions.
Choose relevant categories and skills that align with your services.
Write clear, client-focused gig descriptions that explain the value of your service.

DON’Ts ❌
